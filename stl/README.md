# ThoriTrack - 3D Printable Files

You can find all of the 3D printable STL files in this folder. The files are sorted in `front` and `lens` folders depending on which section of the build they belong to. Files are optimized for FDM (filament) printers and should be printed exactly as oriented as they are already prepared to fit well. You may use PLA for all parts, but the two parts labeled as Frunk may experience some warping from the heat. Pay attention to the printer settings listed for each section and individual parts.

## Front Parts (`front` Folder)

These are the parts used to construct the assembly that is inserted into the Index Frunk and holds all of the main electronics.

Use **0.2mm layer height** for all of these parts.

* `ThoriTrack__Frunk_Upper.stl` - 80% Infill, Supports: **YES** - Supports are used for the Frunk grill inserts.
* `ThoriTrack__Frunk_Lower.stl` - 80% Infill, Supports: NO
* `ThoriTrack__USB_Hub.stl` - 20% Infill, Supports: NO
* `ThoriTrack__ETVR_Cradle.stl` - 20% Infill, Supports: NO
* `ThoriTrack__ETVR_Holder.stl` - 20% Infill, Supports: **YES** - Supports are used for the cable slots.
* `ThoriTrack__Cover.stl` - 20% Infill, Supports: NO
* `ThoriTrack__Face_Upper.stl` - 80% Infill, Supports: NO
* `ThoriTrack__Face_Lower.stl` - 80% Infill, Supports: **YES** - This part is the most difficult to print, use plenty of supports to keep it attached to the plate and print it exactly as oriented.

## Lens Parts (`lens` Folder)

These are the parts used to build the two lens rings. They hold the LEDs and cameras.

Use **0.1mm layer height** for all of these parts.

* `ThoriTrack__EyeRing_Bottom_L.stl` - 100% Infill, Supports: NO
* `ThoriTrack__EyeRing_Bottom_R.stl` - 100% Infill, Supports: NO
* `ThoriTrack__EyeRing_Top_L.stl` - 100% Infill, Supports: **YES** - Supports are used for the LED covers and the camera slot.
* `ThoriTrack__EyeRing_Top_R.stl` - 100% Infill, Supports: **YES** - Supports are used for the LED covers and the camera slot.
* `ThoriTrack__EyeRing_Camera.stl` - 100% Infill, Supports: **YES**, **PRINT TWICE!** - Supports are used for the slot.
